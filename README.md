# Interpreting the ESM Inverse Folding Model

This repo contains my personal edits to the ESM Inverse Folding protein design model, to allow visualization of the model's attention mechanisms and general interpretation of how the model arrives at a generated sequence given an input backbone structure.

Fork of the original model available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm
